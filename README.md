If you want to have an idea about how badly your computations are polluting and feel bad about it, you are in the right place!

## energy_co2_report.sh:

A Bash script to calculate the energy consumption and estimated CO‚ÇÇ emissions of an HPC job on SLURM-managed systems (e.g., JURECA at JSC).  
It separates **scientific compute energy** from the **total job footprint**, enabling accurate sustainability metrics for research workloads.

---

## üîç What It Does

This script retrieves job-level energy consumption from SLURM‚Äôs accounting system using `sacct`, and computes:

- ‚ö° **Scientific Compute Energy** ‚Äî from the main compute step (usually `.0`)
- üåç **Total Job Footprint Energy** ‚Äî includes all setup, wrapper, and retry steps
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Estimated CO‚ÇÇ emissions** ‚Äî using a user-defined CO‚ÇÇ per kWh factor (default: 475 g CO‚ÇÇ/kWh)

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- SLURM with energy accounting enabled
- The following SLURM tools must be available:
  - `sacct`
- Shell tools:
  - `grep`, `cut`, `bc`

Tested on: **JURECA (JSC)** both gpu and cpu!

## üöÄ Usage

Just copy the file where ever you want and run with the job ID in the system you want to check. Only important thing is the job ID.

And I do not consider cooling here. When I have information about it, I will add its effect. 

```bash
chmod +x energy_co2_report.sh
./energy_co2_report.sh <SLURM_JOB_ID>


## üìã Example Output

--------------------·ìÄ ·µ• ·ìÇ-----------------------
 Job ID:                         13657864

 ‚ñ∂ Scientific Compute Step (.0)
   Energy:                       6291420 J
   Energy (kWh):                 1.747616 kWh
   CO‚ÇÇ Emission (scientific):    830.117600 grams

 ‚ñ∂ Total Job Footprint
   Energy:                       18596590 J
   Energy (kWh):                 5.165719 kWh
   CO‚ÇÇ Emission (total):         2453.716525 grams

## üñ•Ô∏è Suggestions -LLview
In order to improve code efficiency you can use LLview to monitor every single detail.

- Simple go to: [on the official JSC page](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc/services/user-support/software-tools/llview?expand=translations,fzjsettings,nearest-institut)

- Select the JSC system you are using.

- Enter your JuDoor credentials.

- Click you name. Here you can see details information about jobs ended in the last 3 weeks.

- Red color in usage means your code is not efficiently using the nodes. (You can see how red my codes are. Don't be me!)

![Sample Output](LLview.png)

- In case you are someone who is hungry for more knowledge, put your mouse on top of the microscopic sized graph symbol shown in the pic as Here!!. you can reach a detailed view of that specific job. You also have current power usage here.

- And the button right next to it downloads the job report. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è General warning

Assumed CO2 conversion factor is just the average of Germany! I am working on getting real numbers for Juelich.

PS. If you will be using Jupiter exascale cluster, good for you. All of its energy is provided by renewable.

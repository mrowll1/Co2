If you want to know how badly your computations are polluting and feel bad about it, you are in the right place!

## energy_co2_report_old.sh:

A Bash script to calculate the energy consumption and estimated CO₂ emissions of an HPC job on SLURM-managed systems (e.g., JURECA at JSC).  
It separates **scientific compute energy** from the **total job footprint**, enabling accurate sustainability metrics for research workloads.

---

## What It Does

This script retrieves job-level energy consumption from SLURM’s accounting system using `sacct`, and computes:

-  **Scientific Compute Energy** — from the main compute step (usually `.0`)
-  **Total Job Footprint Energy** — includes all setup, wrapper, and retry steps
-  **Estimated CO₂ emissions** — using a user-defined CO₂ per kWh factor (default: 175 g CO₂/kWh)

---

##  Requirements

- SLURM with energy accounting enabled
- The following SLURM tools must be available:
  - `sacct`
- Shell tools:
  - `grep`, `cut`, `bc`

Tested on: **JURECA (JSC)** both gpu and cpu!

##  Usage

Run the file wherever you want. The only important thing is the job ID.


```bash
./energy_co2_report.sh <SLURM_JOB_ID>


##  Example Output

--------------------ᓀ ᵥ ᓂ-----------------------
 Job ID:                        <SLURM_JOB_ID>

 ▶ Scientific Compute Step (.0)
   Energy:                       6291420 J
   Energy (kWh):                 1.747616 kWh
   CO₂ Emission (scientific):    830.117600 grams

 ▶ Total Job Footprint
   Energy:                       18596590 J
   Energy (kWh):                 5.165719 kWh
   CO₂ Emission (total):         2453.716525 grams

```

## energy_co2_report.sh:

It does the same calculations as the old version. In addition, it gathers all the information about the jobs that were done in a given period.
It also writes all the results in a .dat file to a given directory.

## What does it do:

-Scans SLURM job history:
    -Looks back over the last N days (default: 10) and retrieves jobs that have completed, failed, or timed out.

-Skips duplicates:
    -Only appends data for jobs not already recorded in the output report.

-Retrieves energy metrics:
  -For each job:
      -Gets energy used by the main compute step (scientific compute energy, from sub-steps). 
      -Gets total job energy (all steps combined).

  -Calculates and logs:
      -Scientific and total energy in kilojoules (kJ) and kilowatt-hours (kWh).
      -Estimated CO₂ emissions (g), using a configurable emissions factor (default: 174 g/kWh).
      -Job partition and UTC start timestamp.

-Summarizes totals:
  -At the top of the report, writes:
      -The sum of scientific and total energy across all recorded jobs.
      -The sum of estimated CO₂ emissions.


##  Suggestions -LLview
To improve code efficiency, you can use LLview to monitor every single detail.

- Simple go to: [on the official JSC page](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc/services/user-support/software-tools/llview?expand=translations,fzjsettings,nearest-institut)

- Select the JSC system you are using.

- Enter your JuDoor credentials.

- Click your name. Here you can see details information about jobs ended in the last 3 weeks.

- Red colour in usage means your code is not efficiently using the nodes. (You can see how red my codes are. Don't be me!)

![Sample Output](LLview.png)

- In case you are someone who is hungry for more knowledge, put your mouse on top of the microscopic sized graph symbol shown in the pic as Here!!. you can reach a detailed view of that specific job. You also have current power usage here.

- And the button right next to it downloads the job report. 

## ⚠️ General warning

The assumed CO2 conversion factor is the maximum of the average in the Juelich Supercomputer Centre (JSC) with cooling effect included. 

PS. If you will be using the Jupiter exascale cluster, good for you. All of its energy is provided by renewable sources.
